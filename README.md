# SocialNetwork


This project consists of creating a social network from scratch where the posts will initially be simply texts and in the future will be changed to be able to add images and shorts/small videos.

This project will be divided into two different structures, a backend that will be summarized in a single API that will be developed in JS, TS using a framework called Nest.JS.

The second structure will be the Frontend which will be developed in TS using Angular and boostrap.

The database that will be used will be a MySQL database.
